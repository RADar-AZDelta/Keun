**Keun** ([West Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Flemish) for [rabbit](https://anw-ivdnt-org.translate.goog/article/keun?_x_tr_sl=nl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=nl&_x_tr_pto=wapp)) is a web based modern variant of the [Usagi](https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:usagi) OMOP [CDM](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) mapping tool.

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE (almost production ready)

# Introduction

Although [Usagi](https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:usagi) does the job, it has some issues:

- It is slow (especially when loading large CSV's)
- You need to install the dictionaries from Athena
- It requires software installation (Java)
- No [four-eye principle](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/four-eye_principle)
- It doesn't do translations
- The search result of Usagi are not on par with [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/)

Therefore we decided to make a modern web variant of Usagi:

- No installation, just run it from your browser
- Made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): cybernetically enhanced web apps
- Includes the super fast [svelte-datatable](https://github.com/RADar-AZDelta/svelte-datatable) component. So it can handle very, very lage CSV files. It uses the [Arquero](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/) library in a web worker.
- Uses [Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/) in the background
- Translation are done by [Bergamot](https://browser.mt/): machine translation done locally in your browser

# Setup

If you want to setup Keun locally on your own device you will need to provide some information in the .env file. The following values are required

```bash
VITE_MAPPINGDATA_PATH= This is the route to the API for your concepts
VITE_ATHENA_DETAIL= This is the detail page of concepts

PUBLIC_CLOUD_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION=
PUBLIC_CLOUD_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION=
PUBLIC_CLOUD_SAVE_IMPLEMENTATION=
```

The PUBLIC_CLOUD_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION is the implementation used to store the data. This is for the file data, settings, ...

The PUBLIC_CLOUD_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION is the implementation used for authentication. At the moment, there is only a Firebase auth implementation. The local implementation let's the user put in his name, but that's all.

The PUBLIC_CLOUD_SAVE_IMPLEMENTATION is the implementation used to save the table configuration from the Svelte-datatable. In the local implementation, this is saved in IndexedDB, but this can also be saved in Firestore or a SQL database.

At the moment there are three implementations made.

##### Local implementation

There is the local implementation, that runs on Github Pages, which uses the browser IndexedDB as database. The files & the settings are written to this database with the principle of cache. Once the file is downloaded, it will be deleted from IndexedDB.

To use the local implementation, you'll need to set the following values in the .env file:

```bash
PUBLIC_CLOUD_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION='none'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION='none'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_SAVE_IMPLEMENTATION='none'
```

##### Firebase implementation

THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

There is an implementation made to use Firebase with Keun. This will use Firestore & Storage from Firebase. You can even host the Keun application on Firebase, but this will need to be configured through the firebase.json with your own firestore & storage rules.

With Firebase you can also enable authentication. Change the firebase.ts file according to the auth provider you'll use.

To implement the Firebase environment, add the following values to your .env file:

```bash
PUBLIC_CLOUD_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION='firebase'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION='firebase'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_SAVE_IMPLEMENTATION='firebase'

PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

The values for Firebase can be found when creating a Firebase project.

##### SQLite implementation

THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This implementation uses a local SQLite database. This implementation is created to simulate how someone could use Keun with a relational database. You could easily upscale from a SQLite implementation to a SQL implementation.

To use the SQLite implementation, set the following values in the .env file:

```bash
PUBLIC_CLOUD_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION='sqlite'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION='sqlite'
PUBLIC_CLOUD_SAVE_IMPLEMENTATION='sqlite'
```

##### Combination

You could combine multiple cloud implementations according to your wishes. You could for example authenticate through Firebase & use a SQL implementation to save the data.

Feel free to create other cloud implementations through a pull request!
